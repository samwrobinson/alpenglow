    This Stitch is used for content heavy interior pages
    that have no design or layout.  Often times these are 
    content silos where you talk extensively about a topic
    to educate your visitors and rank on Google for the 
    content.  These are great for pages that have a TON
    of content.  Design isn't important here, it's all 
    about making the content accessible and easy to read.

                <p>
                    I am a Licensed Clinical Mental Health Counselor in Vermont.  I work with people who know something needs to shift in their lives, but may not know how to take the first steps, or even what path they want to be on. I take a systems approach, helping individuals begin to question systems that oppress them, how to hold the dualities and multiple truths we are faced with, and how to navigate feeling  overstimulated in a world driven by social media where our attention has become a commodity. Together, we look at what matters most to you and how to align your life towards those values.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe in slowness, intention, and rest. Whether we meet in my office or virtually, I  aim to create space for you to slow down and turn inward each week.
                </p>
                <h3>Learn to trust your internal resources and wisdom.</h3>
                <p>
                    I believe that the individuals I work with have the innate ability to know what is best for them. Sometimes life presents us with challenges that cause us to stray from our truth. I work with clients to help them understand what pulls them away from meeting their own needs.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Together, we will explore patterns and systems including:

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Outdoor Education -</strong>  facilitating and coordinating adventure leadership programming for youth and college students.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clinical Intership -</strong> providing trauma therapy for women who were incarcerated.</li>
                    <li><strong>Residential Programming -</strong> supporting youth in their therapeutic work utilizing experiential learning in the outdoors.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>
                    My interests and passions include activities where I create the calm that I desire in my surroundings. These favorite pastimes are also the activities that allow me to consistently show up for my clients and support them in working towards that same calm in their lives.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Winter -</strong> I value the calm, slow, intentionality of winter and that way that the season encourages reflection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross Country Skiing -</strong>  I do my best to carve out weekly time for skiing. Rhythmic and repetitive movement keeps us regulated and ready to take on the day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Radical Rest -</strong> Our mind and body need time to reset. I value not only sleep, but seeking out space, free time, and quiet as often as I am able.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural World -</strong>  I experience peace of mind and regulation when I interact with nature. The natural world reminds me that connection is key to growth.</li>
